#  Program in C++ that implements support of 3D curves hierarchy.
## Run Locally
- Clone the project
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/iceb34r/3Dcurves
```
- Go to the proejct directory
- Open solution file (`curvesproj.sln`) via MS Visual Studio
- Set up the configuration (`MSVC ISO C++14`)
- Run project

## How It Works
- Randomly creates a container with curves (Ellipse, Circle, 3D Helix)
- Prints coordinates and first derivative for each curve in the container
- Shares circles with second container
- Sorts second container in the ascending order of circles radii
- Computes the total sum of radii of all curves in the second container
